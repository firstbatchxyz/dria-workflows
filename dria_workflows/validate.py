Solana's faster transaction finality, just a few seconds compared to Ethereum's ~12 minutes, positions it well for capturing Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and handling greater throughput. Innovations like token extensions, the Firedancer client, and hardware-based scaling show Solana’s ambition. Conversely, Kyle sees Ethereum as slow and directionless, with Layer 2s diverting value away from ETH. He aims to invest in Solana projects, envisioning a future where Solana dominates and Ethereum and Layer 2s are obsolete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Conduct extensive research on aerodynamics and bird flight.      Develop and test various wing designs using scale models.      Acquire lightweight yet sturdy materials for construction.      Design and build a suitable engine for propulsion.      Construct a full-scale prototype.      Conduct rigorous safety tests and make necessary adjustments.     Attempt the first manned flight, documenting all results for scientific posterity",
